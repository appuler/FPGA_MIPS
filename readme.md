Here is my project where I attempt to make a streamlined Pokemon RPG game using an FPGA board

I will only be sharing the final result and assembly code in the files.

Also I created a pokemon bitmap generator for the project which allowed me to convert all my pokemon bitmaps into a hex format so that MIPS CPU can read the data and display on the VGA display.

Here's the link to my project (Please note that I was extremely burntout by the end):
